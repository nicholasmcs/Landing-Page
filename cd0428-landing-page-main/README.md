# Landing Page Project
This project is to showcase the use of javascript specifically the ability to create new sections in the navigation bar without using HTML. To test the code adding an additonal section should create a new navigation section with the ability to seamless scroll to the section upon being clicked. 

## Javascript
The code provided allows the following events to happen:
 1. Created new listed items in the navigation bar
 2. Append sections to navigation, allowing interactivity and respontivity
 3. Make section scrollable upon being clicked on navigation
  

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
